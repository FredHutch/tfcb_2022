# Lecture 17: Immune repertoire sequencing and analysis

We will learn how to work with immune repertoire sequence data. Open lecture17.ipynb in VSCode. Make sure to select the kernel for R so that you can execute R code. You should have already set this up following the software installation instructions from last week.

This lecture will begin with a introduction to immune repertoire sequencing and analysis. We will then undertake a hands-on exercise using R and Bioconductor tools to analyze pre-processed immune repertoire data from two healthy individuals.

## Learning Objectives 
- learn about immune repertoire sequencing
- familiarize with immune repertoire data
- work through an example analysis
    - visualize rearrangement statistics
    - evaluate repertoire overlap between individuals

## Class materials
- The lecture slides are available [here](lecture17_slides.pdf)

- The Notebook which will be using for this lecture is available at [lecture17.ipynb](lecture17.ipynb)
