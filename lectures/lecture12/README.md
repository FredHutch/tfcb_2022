# Lecture 4: Visualize data using R/ggplot2

In addition to the Python programming language, we'll use R (as implemented in the RStudio interface) as a second programming language for data analysis tasks. In general, R is an excellent tool for data manipulation (cleaning, filtering, transforming), analysis (modeling and statistics), and visualization. 

## Learning objectives

- Use the RStudio interface to create R scripts documented with code comments
- Import tabular data into R and create basic data visualizations (scatterplots, line plots) using the R package `ggplot2`

## Class materials

- To view slides in presentation mode, open [`lecture.html`](lecture.html). 
- Data used in these exercises can be found in [`example_dataset_1.tsv`](data/example_dataset_1.tsv).
- If you would like additional reference material for tasks useful to R, important features of RStudio, and plain-language descriptions of how R works, [Data Carpentry's materials](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html) provide additional examples of data manipulation and visualization.

## Reminders

- [Homework 6](../../homeworks/homework06/) is posted today and is due by noon on November 17.
