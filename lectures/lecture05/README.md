# Lecture 05: Next steps in the shell

**Melody Campbell ([@melodygcampbell](https://twitter.com/melodygcampbell), [campbellab.org](http://campbellab.org))**

This lesson builds on the work that we did in the previous session, while adding additional complexity. editing a file using vim, writing a for loop, and writing a basic shell script.

## Learning objectives

After these two lectures, you should be able to:

- Navigate a file system in the shell (lecture 04)
- Run commands in the shell (lecture 04)
- Understand basic usage of redirection (lecture 04)
- Write a for loop (lecture 05)
- Edit a file using vim (lecture 05)
- Write a basic shell script (lecture 05)


In the second lecture, We will go over the commands presented in the previous session. We will use some of these commands to write a for loop that can automate tasks. We will also learn how to edit a file using vim and how to write and submit a shell script. A signficant portion of this session will be dedicated to working though the tutorial.

[The slides will be here](https://fredhutch.github.io/tfcb_2022/lectures/lecture05/slides/slides.html), and if you missed the lecture [here will be a recorded version](https://washington.zoom.us). 

## Tutorial

This is an interactive tutorial to teach you about navigating the shell.

To get started,
[access the unix shell on your computer](https://github.com/FredHutch/tfcb_2022/blob/main/lectures/lecture04/README.md#setup-accessing-a-command-line).
Make sure you're connected to the Fred Hutch network,
either on campus via the Marconi wireless network,
via VPN,
or using `snail` as described [here](https://fredhutch.github.io/tfcb_2021/software/unix_rhino#off-campus-log-in).

Once you have logged on,
execute the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/fredhutch/tfcb_2022.git
    cd tfcb_2022/lectures/lecture04

We recommend keeping a browser open with the lesson materials as you work through the exercises on VS Studio or your computer.
