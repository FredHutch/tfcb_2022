# Lecture 14: Working with biological sequences and annotations using `Bioconductor`


We will learn how to work with DNA sequences and transcript annotations. Open [lecture16.ipynb](./lecture16.ipynb) in VSCode. Make sure to select the `kernel` for `R` so that you can execute `R` code. You should have already set this up following the software installation instructions [here](../../software/README.md).
