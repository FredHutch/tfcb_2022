# Lecture 14: Principles of Data Visualization

Now that we can create basic plots in R, we'll talk more about best practices in data visualization: how are data best represented in a graph? How do we select colors and fonts to effectively convey information? What are the main goals of data visualization? This lecture will provide you with the foundational knowledge you need to continue adapting your code to suit the message conveyed by a visualization.

## Learning objectives

- Identify best practices (and common pitfalls) for data visualization
- Differentiate among different types of data visualization
- Apply strategies for effective data visualization

## Class materials

- To view slides in presentation mode, open [`lecture.html`](lecture.html). 
- To download the in-class exercise, use [class_exercise.md](class_exercise.md) as a template to create a `.Rmd` file with your own title block and code cells.
- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) by Claus Wilke is a great book that describes the concepts behind this lecture in more detail.
