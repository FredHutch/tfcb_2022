# Lecture 09: Practical analyses in Python

This lecture will continue using Python to perform biological sequence analyses.
In particular, we will use [Biopython](https://biopython.org) to read in sequencing data.
We will also briefly use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for handling data frames and plotting.

## Learning objectives

After this lecture, you should be able to write Python functions:

- Parse barcodes from a real deep-sequencing experiment.

- Convert data into a data frame.

- Plot basic data.

## Class materials

- The content for this lecture is containing in the Jupyter notebook [lecture09.ipynb](lecture09.ipynb) located in this directory. Some of the content from lecture 08 is duplicated here for your convenience.
