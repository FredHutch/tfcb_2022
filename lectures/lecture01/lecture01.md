## Introduce yourself!

- Name
- Research interests (type of data, model organism, research questions, etc)
- What are you hoping to get out of this course?

---

## Course objectives

<div style="font-size: smaller;">
By the end of the course, you should be able to:

- Use VSCode to program in Unix/Bash shell, Python, R using appropriate syntax and code convention

- Apply good practices for computational research including project and data organization

- Select appropriate tools to perform specific programming and data analysis tasks

- Analyze common forms of data generated by molecular biology experiments such as flow cytometry, 96-well plate readers, and high throughput sequencing.

</div>

---

## What you won't be able to do

<div style="font-size: smaller;">

- Use ALL of the computational tools your research will require

- Know the best algorithm or analysis method for a specific research question

- Code with expert-level skills

... but you should be equipped to work towards these goals on your own.

</div>

<!-- 
- Learn outside class. You will get most benefit if you spend time studying on your own on the internet.
- Learning curve will be steep. Your ability to do things will be limited for a while. This is quite normal.
- You are really learning a new language and also a new way of thinking about problems and solving them. So it will take time to get comfortable.
- Think of this class as a rapid tour through Africa or Europe or South America where everyone speaks a different language than you. You can appreciate what is there, but to be comfortable or get really good, you need to spend lot of time immersed in that culture.
