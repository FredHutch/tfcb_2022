When you ran `cat start.md` it spat the contents of this file out to the shell.
This is a handy way to look at small files.

We are now going to learn about the command `man`, which is short for "manual."
Before we try that, note:
**you can navigate using the arrow keys, and exit using the letter `q`**.

OK, so now try `man man` to learn about the command `man`.

1. first just enter `man` and then quit
2. then re-enter `man` and use the online help to figure out how to forward and backward one window at a time
3. now look through the contents of the `man` manual to find a flag that will show you the location of the file containing the documentation
4. find the location of the `man` documentation
5. read a little about the `file` command from its man page
6. what is the type of compression that is used to store the `man` information?
7. use the `apropos` command to find a command that will uncompress that file
