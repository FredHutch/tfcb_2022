# Homework 3: Intro and Programming in Python

If you have difficulty viewing this notebook in GitHub, copy the URL to the page and paste it into [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) to render.

This assignment uses output from a genomic analysis. Because the instructions for each question describe the desired output in relation to the specific data provided, you should not need a deep understanding of the specific data to complete the assigned exercises.

**Instructions:**
- Update your clone of the class website on your computer.
- Navigate to the `homeworks/homework03` directory, launch the notebook (`ipynb` file), and add your code to answer each question. Please note that your notebook needs to access the `data` directory in the class repository in order for the included code to run.
- Take advantage of the code chunks included at the bottom of the page!
- Make sure your entire notebook is executable, and has been executed in order (in the "Cell" menu, select "Run All")
