## Reminders 

- [Homework 1 (command line)](../../homeworks/homework01) is due at the beginning of the next class session, and includes material from lectures 3 and 4. Please submit it through Canvas.
- Our next [lectures](../lecture05) require that you have software for Git/GitHub, a text editor, and a spreadsheet program installed. Please see our [software installation instructions](https://fredhutchio.github.io/tfcb_2020/software/) for more information. If you would like to confirm you have the Git command line tools installed, please open your shell interface (e.g., Terminal), type `git`, and you should see the help documentation for `git` printed to the screen. If the tools are not installed, you will receive an error saying the command is not recognized.
