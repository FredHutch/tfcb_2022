## Today's objectives


- Locate information relevant to the course (lecture materials, assessment, communication streams)
- Identify range of skills and concepts covered in this course
- Learn basics of VSCode, Git, Markdown

---

## Zoom logistics

- Same Zoom link for duration of class 
- Separate Zoom link for TA office hours 

<div style="font-size:smaller;">Zoom link pinned on #lectures-homework Slack channel</div>

<br>

#### Etiquette

- Stay muted
- <span style="color: yellow;">Highly encouraged</span>: Unmute yourself and ask questions at any point
- Use Slack for detailed questions (next slide)

---

## Communication

Slack Workspace: TFCB2021

- <span style="color:yellow;">#general</span>: course announcements (please turn on notifications for this channel)
- <span style="color:yellow;">#lectures-homework</span>: questions about course content and help for homework
- see pinned posts in each channel for quick links and reminders

## Introduce yourself!

- Name (including preferred form of address)
- Research interests (type of data, model organism, research questions, etc)

---

## Course objectives

<div style="font-size: smaller;">
By the end of the course, you should be able to:

- Use VSCode to program in R, Python, and Unix/bash shell using appropriate syntax and code convention

- Apply good practices for computational research including project and data organization

- Select appropriate tools to perform specific programming and data analysis tasks

- Analyze common forms of data generated by molecular biology experiments including flow cytometry, 96-well plate readers, and high throughput sequencing.

</div>

---

## What you won't be able to do

<div style="font-size: smaller;">

- Use ALL of the computational tools your research will require

- Know the best algorithm or analysis method for a specific research question

- Code with expert-level skills

... but you should be equipped to work towards these goals on your own.

</div>

<!-- 
- Learn outside class. You will get most benefit if you spend time studying on your own on the internet.
- Learning curve will be steep. Your ability to do things will be limited for a while. This is quite normal.
- You are really learning a new language and also a new way of thinking about problems and solving them. So it will take time to get comfortable.
- Think of this class as a rapid tour through Africa or Europe or South America where everyone speaks a different language than you. You can appreciate what is there, but to be comfortable or get really good, you need to spend lot of time immersed in that culture.
