# Lecture 13: Working with data using tidyverse

Much of the time biologists spend while performing data analysis involves manipulating, reformatting, and transforming data. In this lecture, we'll use `tidyverse` functions from the `dplyr` package to perform these "data munging" tasks. We'll cover a few of the functions available for these tasks and learn a common programming structure (piping), which will equip you to continue developing powerful data manipulation code that will be foundational for visualization and statistical analysis.

## Learning objectives

- Select and apply functions from `tidyverse` to perform manipulations to tabular data
- Apply pipes as a programming structure to connect input and output from multiple functions

## Class materials

- To view slides in presentation mode, open [`lecture.html`](lecture.html). 
- RStudio has a [data manipulation cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) that should help you identify what functions are useful for certain tasks.

## Reminders

- We've had some questions about the difference between R Markdown documents and R Notebooks. The short answer is that R Notebooks are a specialized document written in R Markdown that updates as you run the code, while regular R Markdown documents need to be knit at the end of writing code for content to appear in the final document. More information can be found [here](http://uc-r.github.io/r_notebook).
