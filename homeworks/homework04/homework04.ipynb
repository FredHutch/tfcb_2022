    "For the homework, you are going to extend the code from real biological analysis of our FASTQ files in lectures 8 and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the Jupyter notebook for that lecture, the FASTQ reads can originate from **either** HA or NA, and that will be distinguished by the most 3' end of the read.\n",
    "But in our example, we did not distinguish among reads matching to HA and NA, as we didn't even look far enough into the read to tell the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the homework, your goal is to write code that extends the material from lectures 8 and 9 to also distinguish between HA and NA, and then eventually get those results into a single data frame from which you can plot a histogram of read counts facetted by gene (HA/NA).\n",
    "This homework can be completed almost entirely be re-using code from lecture 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please include code to address each of the following questions. Please include code comments to explain what your code is attempting to accomplish. Don't forget to include references to the sources you used to obtain your answer, including your classmates (if you are working in groups).  "
